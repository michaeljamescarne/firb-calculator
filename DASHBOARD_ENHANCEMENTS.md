## Data Flow

### **1. Calculation Phase:**

```
User fills form → handleCalculate() → calculateAllFees() → state.calculatedFees
```

**State Object:**
```javascript
state.calculatedFees = {
    firb: 15200,
    stampDuty: 68000,
    legal: 3500,
    foreignTotal: 86700,
    standard: { ... },
    standardTotal: 87500,
    annual: { ... },
    annualTotal: 32890,
    grandTotal: 174200,
    firstYearTotal: 207090,
    depositPercent: 30,
    entityType: 'individual'
}
```

---

### **2. Dashboard Render Phase:**

```
goToStep('results') → render() → renderResultsDashboard()
```

**Components Called:**
1. `renderSummaryCards(fees)` - Top cards
2. `renderVisualizationSection(fees)` - Chart containers
3. `renderComparisonMetrics(fees, propertyValue)` - Comparison cards
4. `renderDetailedBreakdown(fees)` - Collapsible sections
5. `renderActionButtons()` - Payment/download buttons

---

### **3. Chart Initialization Phase:**

```
render() → setTimeout → initializeDashboardCharts()
```

**Charts Rendered:**
1. `renderPieChart(fees)` - Uses React/ReactDOM/Recharts
2. `renderDonutChart(fees)` - Uses React/ReactDOM/Recharts
3. `renderBarChart(allStateCosts)` - Uses React/ReactDOM/Recharts

**Chart Containers:**
- `#pie-chart-container`
- `#donut-chart-container`
- `#bar-chart-container`

---

### **4. Comparison Calculation:**

**Function:** `calculateComparisonScenarios(fees, propertyValue)`

**Process:**
1. Loop through all 8 states
2. For each state, recalculate `calculateAllFees()`
3. Build array of state costs
4. Sort to find cheapest/most expensive
5. Calculate citizen cost (remove FIRB + surcharges)
6. Calculate property type alternatives
7. Return comparison object

**Output:**
```javascript
{
    bestState: { state: 'NT', total: 147660, savings: 25340 },
    worstState: { state: 'WA', total: 208780, difference: 35780 },
    citizenCost: 142500,
    foreignPremium: 30500,
    propertyTypeComparison: { ... },
    allStateCosts: [ ... ]
}
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Recharts Dependency:**

   - Could use lighter chart library (Chart.js, D3)
   - Trade-off: Recharts easier to use, better for React apps

2. **State Comparison Performance:**
   - Recalculates fees for all 8 states
   - Could be optimized with memoization
   - Currently acceptable (< 50ms total)

3. **Static 10-Year Projection:**
   - Assumes no rate increases
   - Real-world: rates typically increase 2-3% annually
   - Could add inflation calculator

4. **Tooltip Positioning:**
   - Always appears above icon
   - May clip at top of viewport on scroll
   - Could improve with smart positioning

5. **Chart Accessibility:**
   - Recharts has limited ARIA support
   - Screen readers may not fully describe charts
   - Could add data tables as alternative
