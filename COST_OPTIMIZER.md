---

### **4. Structure Optimization** ✅

**Three Purchase Structures Analyzed:**

#### **Option 1: Joint Purchase (50/50 with Australian)**

**How It Works:**
- Purchase 50% share with Australian citizen/PR
- Only your 50% subject to foreign buyer surcharges
- Partner pays standard rates

**Calculations:**
- Your share: 50% of purchase price
- Partner share: 50% of purchase price
- FIRB fee: Still required (full amount)
- Your stamp duty: On 50% with surcharge
- Partner stamp duty: On 50% no surcharge
- Total savings vs. 100% foreign ownership

**Risks:**
- Co-ownership disputes
- Relationship breakdown
- Exit strategy complexity
- Financing difficulties

**Requirements:**
- Australian citizen or PR co-buyer
- Both must qualify for financing
- Legal agreement essential
- FIRB approval still needed

#### **Option 2: Company Structure**

**How It Works:**
- Australian company with majority Australian directors
- May reduce foreign buyer surcharges (estimated 50% reduction)
- Complex tax implications

**Calculations:**
- Company setup costs: $5,000
- Ongoing compliance: $3,000/year
- Potential surcharge reduction: 50%
- Total first year costs
- Net savings

**Risks:**
- Complex tax treatment
- Ongoing compliance burden
- CGT on sale
- May not eliminate all foreign buyer duties
- FIRB may still classify as foreign

**Requirements:**
- Majority Australian directors
- Professional legal/tax advice
- Annual financial statements
- ASIC compliance

#### **Option 3: Discretionary Trust**

**How It Works:**
- Purchase through family trust
- Asset protection and tax flexibility
- Usually still subject to foreign buyer surcharges

**Calculations:**
- Trust setup: $3,000
- Ongoing costs: $2,000/year
- Stamp duty: Standard foreign buyer rates
- Usually no surcharge reduction

**Benefits:**
- Asset protection
- Tax planning flexibility
- Estate planning
- Income distribution options

**Risks:**
- Still subject to foreign buyer rules
- Complex tax implications
- Ongoing costs
- May complicate financing

**Requirements:**
- Professional legal setup
- Annual tax returns
- FIRB approval still needed
- Trustee responsibilities

**Important Disclaimers:**
- All structures require professional legal and tax advice
- Regulations vary by state
- Tax implications are complex
- FIRB approval typically still required
- Savings estimates only

---

### **5. Personalized Action Plan** ✅

**Automatic Priority Assessment:**
- Analyzes all optimization strategies
- Ranks by potential savings
- Assigns priority levels (High/Medium/Low)
- Shows complexity and timeframe

**Action Plan Includes:**
- Recommended action
- Potential savings
- Complexity level (Low/Medium/High)
- Timeframe (Immediate/months/years)
- Priority ranking

**Priority Criteria:**
- High: >$10k savings, low complexity, immediate
- Medium: >$20k savings, medium complexity, consider for future
- Low: Requires professional advice, high complexity

**Example Actions:**
1. Consider switching to new apartment (High priority, $15k savings)
2. Explore properties in Adelaide (Medium priority, $25k savings)
3. Pursue 189-Skilled pathway to PR (Medium priority, $85k savings, 12 months)
4. Consult lawyer about joint purchase (Low priority, $40k savings, complex)

---

### **6. Total Potential Savings** ✅

**Maximum Savings Card:**
- Sum of all best-case optimizations
- Percentage of total costs
- Prominent display with emoji
- "Theoretical maximum" disclaimer

**Calculations:**
- Property type savings (if applicable)
- State arbitrage max savings
- Timing optimization savings
