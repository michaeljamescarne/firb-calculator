**Functions:**

1. **Alert Generators:**
   - `generateEligibilityAlerts()` - Returns alerts for eligibility page
   - `generateCalculatorAlerts()` - Returns alerts for calculator form
   - `generateResultsAlerts(fees)` - Returns alerts for results dashboard

   - `renderAlertsSection(alerts, title)` - Renders alert section with title
   - `getEligibilityAlertsHTML()` - Entry point for eligibility page
   - `getCalculatorAlertsHTML()` - Entry point for calculator page
   - `getResultsAlertsHTML(fees)` - Entry point for results page

3. **Utilities:**
   - `calculateFIRBDeadline()` - Calculates FIRB application deadline dates
   - `addAlertStyles()` - Injects CSS for animations

---

### **Alert Data Structure**

```javascript
{
    type: 'WARNING',  // WARNING, INFO, SUCCESS, PENALTY
    title: 'Alert Title',
    message: 'Detailed explanation of the alert',
    action: 'Recommended action to take' // Optional
}
```

---

### **ALERT_TYPES Configuration**

```javascript
const ALERT_TYPES = {
    WARNING: {
        bg: 'bg-red-50',
        border: 'border-red-200',
        icon: '‚ö†Ô∏è',
        iconColor: 'text-red-600',
        textColor: 'text-red-900',
        titleColor: 'text-red-900'
    },
    // ... other types
};
```

---

### **Integration Points**

**1. index.html**
- Added `<script src="js/alerts.js"></script>` before render.js

**2. js/render.js**
- **renderEligibilityResult()**: Added `getEligibilityAlertsHTML()` call
- **renderCalculator()**: Added `getCalculatorAlertsHTML()` call
- **render()**: Added `addAlertStyles()` call

**3. js/resultsDashboard.js**
- **renderResultsDashboard()**: Added `getResultsAlertsHTML(fees)` call after summary cards

---

## Alert Logic

### **Property Type Eligibility Check**

**Non-Resident:**
```javascript
if (citizenship === 'foreign' && residency === 'notResident') {
    if (propertyType === 'established') {
        // CRITICAL WARNING: Not eligible
    }
}
```

**Temporary Resident:**
```javascript
if (residency === 'temporary' && propertyType === 'established' && purpose === 'investment') {
    // WARNING: Only allowed for principal residence
}
```

---

### **Savings Opportunity Detection**

**Property Type Comparison:**
```javascript
if (propertyType === 'established') {
    const newDwellingFees = calculateAllFees({ ...formData, propertyType: 'newDwelling' });
    const savings = fees.firstYearTotal - newDwellingFees.firstYearTotal;
    if (savings > 10000) {
        // SUCCESS: Show savings opportunity
    }
}
```

**State Comparison:**
```javascript
states.forEach(s => {
    const tempFees = calculateAllFees({ ...formData, state: s });
    if (tempFees.firstYearTotal < cheapestCost) {
        cheapestState = s;
        cheapestCost = tempFees.firstYearTotal;
    }
});
if (cheapestState !== currentState && savings > 5000) {
    // SUCCESS: Show cheaper state
}
```

---

### **FIRB Deadline Calculation**

**Algorithm:**
1. Get current date
2. Add 60 days (recommended deadline for 90-day settlement)
3. Format as Australian date
4. Calculate urgent deadline (30 days)

```javascript
function calculateFIRBDeadline() {
    const today = new Date();
    const recommendedDate = new Date(today);
    recommendedDate.setDate(today.getDate() + 60);

    return {
        recommended: recommendedDate.toLocaleDateString('en-AU'),
        urgent: urgentDate.toLocaleDateString('en-AU'),
        daysFromNow: 60
    };
}
```

---

## Visual Design
